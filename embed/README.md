# Embed Command
Create an embed message with title/description/image/channel inside discord itself, sent as bot.

Has actions that await your response and checks each one, will then send embed with random color to the channel of your choice.
You can use the image URL or type none for no image.

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and mods.
