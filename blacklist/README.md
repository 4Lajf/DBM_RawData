# BlackListDBM
Blacklist command for Discord Bot Maker

The main command and the blacklist_test command are required, the blacklist test shows you the four things you need to put before all of your commands to get the blacklist to work.

The third command, blacklisted is for users to check wether or not theyre blacklisted.

Command usage: [p]blacklist <add | remove | check> @user> [reason]
- The reason is only needed on add, it has checks to make sure you put a reason.
- It has checks to make sure you don't add/remove someone already on/off the blacklist.

Command usage: [p]blacklisted (@user)
- This command is for users, used by itself tells them if theyre blacklisted or if used with an @user tells them if another user is blacklisted.

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
