# Brazzers logo over user pfp
Original Authors: Drifted & Eggsy

I took this command from them and fixed it up, as the photo has also poofed off the internet. This now also works without needing to mention a user.

Puts Brazzers logo over your or a mentioned users profile pic then sends the image to chat, pretty simple.
