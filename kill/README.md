A kill command Similar to Dank Memer's kill command where you mention a user and it sends a message about how The Command Author Killed Them. 
Usage: [p]kill @user

I added more responses and changed all the "jump to action" to "skip actions" to work with my blacklist system.
Also posting to github as original is a link to ghostpin which is shutting down.

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
